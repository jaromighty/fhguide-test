    #     We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
    #     That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
    #     space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
    #     coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
    #     sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
